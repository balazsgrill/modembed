<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
MODembed is an experimental IDE aiming to provide a more advanced toolchain for embedded software development.
It provides a clear and simple language designed to help the developer to solve problems in his/her way.
The language is truly platform and acrhitecure independent, the way it compiles to binary is also described
by the language itself.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Why would anybody want a new language? What is the problem with the existing ones? Two languages dominate
the low-end microcontrollers (along with many platform-specific languages): C and Assembler. Assembler
is not a real language, it is too low-level to provide a useful way to solve complex problem. Nowadays
a developer can expect a high-level language which make things easier. For most, C is the only answer.
However, C is a complex language, which is hard to analyze and compile to low-power microcontrollers (and 
I don&apos;t like it personally).
