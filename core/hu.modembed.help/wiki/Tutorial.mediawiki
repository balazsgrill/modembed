The following step-by-step guide will introduce you to the tool&apos;s features, by implementing a led blinking software on a PIC16F1824 device.

== Setting up the workspace ==

First of all, you should import some provided libraries to the workspace. These libraries define some platform to build your program upon:

[[File:tutorial/tutorial-01.png|border|Open the import wizard]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-02.png|border|Select "Import common code Project"]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-03.png|border|Select both "e.core" and "microchip.pic16" projects to import]]

== Creating your own Embedded Project ==

Next, you should create a project to contain your code:
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-04.png|border|Open the new project wizard]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-05.png|border|Select "New e Project"]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-06.png|border|Name your project, then hit "Finish"]]

== Configure project ==

Your project needs to be configured to be able to use code from other projects:

[[File:tutorial/tutorial-07.png|border|Open project properties]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-08.png|border|Select "Project references" and make both e.core and microchip.pic16 referenced]]

== Import PIC device library ==

The microchip.pic16 project contains the libraries required to compile to PIC16 architecture, but the
device-specific register definitions need to be imported separately: 

[[File:tutorial/tutorial-09.png|border|Open the import wizard on your project]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-10.png|border|Select "Import PIC library"]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-11.png|border|Enter the device name. Hint: if you press Ctrl+Space in the device input
field, a content assist will help you selecting an available device]]

== Write your program ==

Now, it is time to start the real work by creating a source file to contain your main function:

[[File:tutorial/tutorial-12.png|border|Select "New/File"]]
[[File:tutorial/tutorial-13.png|border|Enter a name to your file. It must have an extension ".e" to be an e source file]]

This file will be a library, which defines your main function:

<code>
library main;

use e.platform;
use microchip.PIC16F1824;

main(){

}
</code>
