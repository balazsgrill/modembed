<h1>The "e" language</h1>

<p>The "e" language ("e" stands for embedded) can be used to describe programs for low-power microcontrollers.
It is designed to be architecture-independent and to allow programmers to choose the level of abstraction
she/he wants to use in different parts of the program.</p>

<h2>Architecture independence</h2>

<p>Architecture independence is solved through the generalization of the processor instructions. Binary
instruction words are the most low-level type of operations. Higher level operations can be defined using
a series of lower level operations.</p>   

<p>The output of a program is a binary, for example in hex format. The linking and the construction of the
binary blocks is also controlled by language elements. Yes, no need for link scripts and linking after
compilation.</p>

<h2>Compile-time and runtime expressions</h2>

<p>In e, there is two type of expressions: Compile-time and runtime, which are not required to be defined
as one by the programmer, its kind is determined by the compiler. The main difference between the two is
the following: if an expression can be evaluated at compile time, it will be. This eliminates the need of
preprocessing and macros, there is no drawback in using operations for compile-time calculations. </p>

<p>The same applies to operation calling. If it can be inlined (and it worth inlining), it will be inlined.
There will be no call and return with stack population.</p>
